add my user
sudo adduser jay
sudo usermod -aG sudo jay

I added my public key on my personal computer and then
copied it to /home/jay/.ssh/authorized_keys on the cloud server

I disabled password login and root SSH access in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
I didn't want to change the port that the server listens on because its a pain
trying to do -p <port number> EVERY time I wanna ssh into the machine


for the fail to ban setup, i did sudo apt install fail2ban -y 
and then sudo systemctl enable --now fail2ban to constantly start the server fail2ban 
everytime i boot up the linux server
