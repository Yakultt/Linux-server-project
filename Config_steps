add my user
sudo adduser jay
sudo usermod -aG sudo jay

I added my public key on my personal computer and then
copied it to /home/jay/.ssh/authorized_keys on the cloud server

I disabled password login and root SSH access in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
I also changed the port to only listen on port 6767 so when you try to ssh into the 
machine for the user jay, you have to KNOW and specify the port 6767 (i am so corny i know)


for the fail to ban setup, i did sudo apt install fail2ban -y 
and then sudo systemctl enable --now fail2ban to constantly start the server fail2ban 
everytime i boot up the linux server
